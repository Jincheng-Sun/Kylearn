Use my package to train the model, 2 problems, have trouble saving models, and the results are all 0.

11 June
Try my own framework on 2 different networks, cnn and resnet, turns out the saving problem is from the framework, and the output problem is from the network, Fuck the stupid tensorflow, may you be abandoned by users.

17 June
Get a new dataset from Alex, it has 183 PM values [15:198], 47 types of alarms in one-hot format [198:245]. 43071 devices in 568 nodes(TID). 92 meta_PEC and 10769 meta_AID, 2,077,799 rows of data.

For May dataset, create predicting data for all ETH* devices 638564:3865 -> 551992:2569, OTM* 330727:634 -> 302953:280

18 June
As Alex requested, m=3 n=2, for all OTM0-4 devices focus on far_end_client_signal_fail_unplanned

statistic:
before the rule
FACILITY	total samples		positive_samples
OTM0      	61,583	           	135	
OTM1      	2,130	           	3
OTM2      	160,741	   		155
OTM3      	120	           	9
OTM4      	114.985	   		245

after the rule
negative sample:    326,344
positive sample:     418

Then Alex mentioned that there are duplicates in the dataset, 

19 June

change the fpr formula

Focus on loss of signal

Filter out certain alarm

For ETH*
0                 638560
Loss Of Signal       698

For OTM*
0                 330727
Loss Of Signal        99

For OPTMON
0                 1849845
Loss Of Signal        198

My ResnetModel class have some problem, using resnet + CNN model works fine

June 26
Solve the resnet problem, by using moving mean and moving average, these parameters should be updated

next step:
create only alarm dataset, filter out lazer far end and loss of frame
import attention mechanism
evaluation using dot operation Y(x) as the real label and Y'(x) as the predicted label, A(Y1,Y2) as the accuracy, acc = A(Y(X), Y(X).Y'(X))
write report

1.create dataset:
two parts input:device type and PM values
device type: one hot or not? PM: auto encoder


July 3
1. Build attention mechanism, but something was wrong about the attn_model
2. Fixed the bug above, it's the problem of `training` in batch normalization.
3. multi-class classification should use cross-entropy
